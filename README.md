Hello Guys This is ME Aaditya Soni, Learning Arduino and Making it Easier for you to learn Arduino.

So in This we will be learning how to Connect and paly with LDR Sensor

Firstly Lets understand what are we working on,

An LDR or Light Dependent Resistor is a type of resistor whose resistance will change with the level of light we are ambienting on it.

In Simple words the more light the more resistance it will show you.

So getting Forward I have Shared the Circuit Diagram and code with you, you can take help and if you have any Problem you can leave a comment here.
